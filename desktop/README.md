# SSGG desktop

Developer guide for the Electron + React + TypeScript console. For ordinary use, follow the [Ubuntu installation guide](../docs/installation.md) and [usage guide](../docs/usage.md). No renderer shell, arbitrary filesystem paths, network client or production fixture fallback.

## Build and launch locally

Prerequisites: Linux, Node/npm, the repository's Rust toolchain and native build dependencies, a running PipeWire-Pulse or PulseAudio session, and **pactl** (`pulseaudio-utils` on Debian/Ubuntu; `libpulse` on Arch). Electron needs the usual GTK/NSS/GBM libraries and a working Chromium sandbox. `xvfb` is only needed for headless smoke tests.

```sh
cd desktop
npm ci --include=dev
npm run build:local
npm run launch -- --read-only   # real inventory; no audio/HID changes
npm run launch                 # normal controls, explicit opt-in hardware
```

To reuse a trusted, already compiled Rust binary instead of running Cargo:

```sh
npm run build:local -- /absolute/path/to/ssgg-desktop
```

The build stages a mode-755 binary under the private, ignored `local-bin/` directory, builds the UI/preload/main outputs, and renders `local-bin/ssgg-desktop-local.service`. No installed binaries, user configuration or services are changed. A source checkout's group-writable Cargo output is copied, not chmodded in place. These are runnable **local artifacts**, not a portable installer. The generated unit contains this checkout's absolute executable path; the portable template is `../assets/ssgg-desktop.service`.

`npm start` remains a development shortcut using the default `../target/debug/ssgg-desktop` or an absolute `SSGG_SIDECAR` override. The bridge rejects group/world-writable executables. Packaged builds ignore the override and require a trusted binary in `process.resourcesPath`.

## Build Ubuntu packages

Build on Ubuntu 24.04 amd64 for the compatibility baseline. The desktop binary has no compile-time PulseAudio dependency; install build tools (`build-essential`, `pkg-config`, `unzip`, `binutils`, `apparmor`, `desktop-file-utils`) and the pinned Rust toolchain. Native optional audio-feature tests also require `libpulse-dev`. Headless GUI tests need `xvfb`, `xauth`, `x11-utils` and `dbus-x11`.

```sh
cd desktop
npm ci --include=dev
npm run package:app       # Electron + renderer + matching Rust service
npm run package:deb       # also builds and checks release/ssgg-gui_0.1.0_amd64.deb
npm run test:packaging
```

Packaging compiles Rust for generic `x86-64`, overriding inherited developer CPU tuning, and always extracts the checksum-verified official Electron archive, never a development `node_modules/electron/dist` tree. A custom `--sidecar` must already be built for the intended CPU baseline; ELF architecture/GLIBC checks alone cannot certify every instruction in an externally supplied binary. It checks ELF architecture/GLIBC requirements, rejects shipped symlinks, and validates the desktop entry and AppArmor syntax. The standalone output is `release/app`; unprivileged extraction cannot establish the root ownership of the DEB's sandbox helper.

The Ubuntu CI job installs the DEB on a disposable runner, launches the actual packaged binary in a private session without a helper override, and purges it while checking that user data survives. Archive inspection and local extraction tests alone do not certify fresh installation, Wayland/GNOME Shell behavior or hardware access.

Snap builds consume the same standalone tree; see the [Snap guide](../snap/README.md). Strict confinement's HID, browser-sandbox and cross-app audio limitations are release gates, not errors to bypass.

## Independent service (optional)

To keep mixing when the GUI quits, start the standalone Rust service **before** opening SSGG:

```sh
# In its own terminal; no installer or systemd changes:
./local-bin/ssgg-desktop
# Then, in another terminal:
npm run launch
```

The daemon listens at `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/ssgg-desktop/service.sock`. Electron prefers this socket after checking owner, filesystem type, no symlinks at the runtime directory/service directory/socket, and private permissions (0700 directories, 0600 socket). Renderer IPC cannot select a socket or executable. There is no TCP listener started by production code.

A connected external service is **never killed or reset on GUI quit**. A window-owned `--stdio` sidecar is used only when no socket is available, and is labelled accordingly. A failed/untrusted existing socket is an error, not permission to start a competing service. After a previously attached service disappears, refresh retries the socket without falling back to a competitor. Reopening a hidden window also resumes polling/reconnection. Config-lock conflicts show a specific recovery message.

The optional systemd user-unit template is supplied, **not installed or enabled**. It uses a restrictive umask, runtime directory, no new privileges, and no automatic hardware acquisition. Do not run the legacy `ssgg` audio loop concurrently against the same devices/audio policies. Service startup itself only inventories; hardware and ChatMix require separate explicit activation.

Assignments, group gains and profiles are persisted by Rust. Hardware ownership and mixer activation are session state and must be re-enabled after restart/disconnection. Loss/staleness disarms hardware mixing without restoring gains or rerouting audio. Closing a GUI is not the same as restarting a service. Login/logout lifetime is determined by how the standalone process is managed.

## Safe inspection

`--read-only` always launches a **separate `--stdio --safe-mode` process with an isolated temporary config**, even if a writable socket is available. Electron also denies all audio, HID and profile mutation IPC; the read-only badge is not the security boundary. Real inventory is retained. No HID acquisition/query is initiated by opening the GUI. In unpackaged development, `SSGG_READ_ONLY=1` is equivalent.

The tray preference is local desktop state. “Keep running in the tray” hides the window. If using stdio, quitting ends the owned child; if connected via socket, the external owner continues. Desktop settings display transport and persistence consequences explicitly.

## Controls and observation

- Streams use validated numeric backend IDs. Requested gain remains **0..1**; observed native amplification above 100% is retained, not clamped or rejected. Native effective volume/mute is displayed separately from base intent, group gain and ChatMix. A bounded base slider cannot request amplification.
- Generic `WEBRTC VoiceEngine` labels use the backend's JSON app-key executable when present (for example `Discord`); the original raw application/stream remains the subtitle. Unknown identity is never guessed. A browser's already combined tabs cannot be separated.
- Group **ChatMix side** assignment is independent of whether ChatMix is enabled or a physical wheel is available.
- `device.set` is a narrow named API: selected ID, explicit hardware acquisition/release, sidetone 0..3, auto-off 0..255, status refresh. Controls require backend capability support and are disabled in safe mode. Baseline `UNSUPPORTED` remains a visible failure.
- **Use headset wheel** is available directly in Mixer for one connected supported receiver. The explicit click acquires that receiver if needed, shows **Connecting to headset…**, and polls `getState` every 250 ms for up to 8 seconds for a matching, acquired, connected, non-stale sample with no pending operation/error. Only then does it select `inputMode: hardware` and read back confirmation. Already-acquired hardware needs no second opt-in. No `enabled: true`, balance, group or application changes are sent by setup.
- Acquisition/source selection does **not** enable mixing. Source state (**Headset wheel active**) and mixer state (**ChatMix is off**) are separate. If ChatMix is already on, the setup action discloses that selecting the wheel immediately uses its current position. The frontend never switches source on detection/reconnection or retries automatically after failure. On-screen balance remains a separate explicit choice.
- Read-only sessions, unavailable/older services, unsupported headsets and missing USB receivers have nearby reasons and recovery guidance. Multiple receivers require an explicit device choice. Connection failures stay visible with **Retry headset wheel**; **Cancel wheel setup**, leaving Mixer, or timeout prevents a late acquisition/read from subsequently selecting the source. Acquisition already accepted by the service may remain in place; release it in Devices if desired. Cancellation is available during connection, before the source command is sent.
- Hardware samples expose independent A/B gains; a scalar slider is only a disabled visualization, never converted back to a software request. No sample means no invented centered wheel.
- Wireless connection, battery, last status/wheel timestamps, pending/error states, verified sidetone and sent-only auto-off are distinguished. `supported` means source-supported; `locallyValidated` is separate and currently false. This frontend integration does not claim physical command validation.
- Saved profile names follow Rust's nonempty, at-most-80-UTF-8-byte policy, including punctuation. They are JSON names, not filesystem paths.

## Tests

```sh
npm test
npm run typecheck
npm run smoke
# In-Mixer wheel flow, real sandboxed Electron + private fixture only:
xvfb-run -a node tests/wheel-setup-smoke.mjs
# Real inventory only; uses the staged local binary and never acquires HID:
SSGG_PACTL=/absolute/path/to/pactl xvfb-run -a node tests/launch-readonly.mjs
SSGG_SIDECAR="$PWD/local-bin/ssgg-desktop" xvfb-run -a node tests/live-readonly.mjs
```

`smoke` runs real sandboxed Electron, checks renderer Linux seccomp/context isolation, native control bridge requests/read-back, profiles, tray lifetime, private UDS transport/reconnection, external owner survival, config-lock error, unsupported hardware rejection and safe-mode gating. Fixture sidecars are installed as private 755 test copies; production executable validation is not relaxed. Unit tests cover amplified observations, hardware DTO/commands, profile names, stale photo promises, disabled slider synchronization and pre-decode artwork limits. Hardware tests use fixtures; no live audio/HID writes are performed.

The actual local-launch check exercises `scripts/launch.mjs` with real Rust safe inventory and checks 1320/900px layouts. Artifacts are ignored under `artifacts/`; read-only design evidence also lives under `.impeccable/review`.

### Chromium sandbox

Never pass `--no-sandbox` or disable host security. Playwright sets `chromiumSandbox:true` explicitly. An npm-installed Electron helper is not automatically root-owned. Development-only extraction checks can use an existing trusted, root-owned 4755 helper in a separate test tree, but must disclose that override in their evidence. **Never ship a machine-specific helper symlink.** The Debian builder extracts a checksum-verified pristine runtime and gives the genuine packaged helper its required ownership/mode. Installed-package CI must run without a test helper override. Headless tests select X11 explicitly for Xvfb; normal launch keeps platform defaults.

## Artwork and privacy

Exact-model photography is optional and downloaded only on request from the catalogued manufacturer URL, or chosen through a native local picker. Only static PNG and ordinary baseline/progressive JPEG are accepted. A bounded header/chunk scan enforces 8 MiB input, 8000px per side and 16-megapixel budgets **before native decoding**, including cached image reads; malformed/truncated metadata, SVG and animated PNG are rejected. Device/request generations prevent a late photo from being displayed as another selected model.

SteelSeries owns its product photography; it is not bundled or relicensed with this code. The catalog records model, URL and attribution; cached sidecars retain provenance. The black-variant disclaimer remains visible because USB IDs do not identify casing color. Unknown models get no substitute image. No accounts, promotions, telemetry, automatic downloads or synthetic meters.
